 ```bash
 brew install node
 ```
- **Ubuntu/Linux:**
 ```bash
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install nodejs npm
 ```

## üß™ APIs Used


| Purpose                    |  Service     |
| :------------------------- |  :---------- |
| **Bar Chart Usage Data**   |  mockapi.io  |
| **Form Submit (POST)**     |  mockapi.io  |
| **User Activity List (GET)** | mockapi.io  |


---


## üìå Assumptions Made
- Backend functionality is simulated using public mock API services.
- Submitted form data is not persisted on the mock API (mock POST).
- The bar chart's "Yearly API Usage" data is fetched from a mock API endpoint.
- Styling is kept minimal and relative to company's website but ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes.
